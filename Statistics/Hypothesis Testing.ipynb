    "* A hypothesis test **evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.** \n",
    "* These two statements are called the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**.\n",
    "* Hypothesis tests are **not 100% accurate** because they use a random sample to draw conclusions about entire populations. \n",
    "* When you perform a hypothesis test, there are two types of errors related to drawing an incorrect conclusion.\n",
    "    * **Type I error**: The rejects a null hypothesis that is true. You can think of this as a **false positive**.\n",
    "    * **Type II error**: The test fails to reject a null hypothesis that is false. You can think of this as a **false negative**."

    "> ### Regression: assess if change in one variable predicts change in another variable\n",
    "> * **Simple regression:** Tests how change in the predictor variable predicts the level of change in the outcome variable\n",
    "> * **Multiple regression:** Tests how change in the combination of two or more predictor variables predict the level of change in the outcome variable\n",

    "> ### Non-parametric: are used when the data does not meet assumptions required for parametric tests\n",
    "> * **Wilcoxon rank-sum test:** Tests for difference between two independent variables - takes into account magnitude and direction of difference\n",
    "> * **Wilcoxon sign-rank test:** Tests for difference between two related variables - takes into account magnitude and direction of difference\n",
    "> * **Sign test:** Tests if two related variables are different â€“ ignores magnitude of change, only takes into account direction"
